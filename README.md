# Snake, built with Compose for Desktop


`snake-compose-for-desktop` is my implementation of the classic snake game using [Compose for Desktop](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose/). Run with `./gradlew run`.

Use the arrow keys to move the snake around and Escape to quit the game. Collect the apples (red dots) but avoid hitting your own tail!
